Hello Jean and Bryan, welcome to my assessment repo!

Questions:

1. What did you like about this project? I liked that we had the opportunity to apply what we had learnt

2. What did you struggle with in this project? Time management, over=estimation of myself and also the realisation that I did not have sufficient knowledge to successfully accomplish the task. The concept I particularly struggled with was flexbox, its properties and how to manipulate it. I am also disappointed that I was unable to complete the media query in the task.

3. What would make your experience with this assessment better? Having a more thorough understanding of flexbox
