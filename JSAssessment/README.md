Questions:

1. What did you like about this project? I liked that we did not have to do the assessment from scratch as it was way beyond my understanding level

2. What did you struggle with in this project? My grasp of JS fundamentals, especially arrays, how objects and classes interact with each other, and manipulation of these objects to give the desired outcome. I took much more time to complete the game vs my peers unfortunately.   

3. What would make your experience with this assessment better? Having more practice coding with assignments of this level as I feel the gap between the fundamentals we learn in class vs the assessment is quite large. For myself, even with self-study on codecademy, i still found it very difficult to grasp the concepts required for this assessment.
