# hello-world

Super excited to join the coding community!

I'm currently in a bootcamp and wil be learning the following in these 3 months!
<br>
• Front-End Development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript | Back-End Development: Java, Spring Boot and MySQL
<br>
• Collaboration: Git, Agile and Scrum
<br>
Followed by a 6-month apprenticeship to apply the skills learnt in the workplace
<br>

Here are some of the projects I've been working on! They are no where near perfect and far from being completed, but it shows the progress I'm slowly making :)

Thanks for stopping by!
